# 🎮 Video Game Sales Analysis Using MySQL and PowerBi

In this project, I utilized MySQL and Power BI to perform a comprehensive analysis of video game sales data. The dataset includes various attributes such as game titles, platforms, release years, genres, and sales figures across different regions.

MySQL was employed to manage and query the dataset, enabling efficient data processing and extraction of key insights.
Power BI was used to create dynamic dashboards that visually represent the data, highlighting trends, top-selling games, and regional performance metrics. These dashboards provide an interactive way to explore the dataset and support data-driven decision-making.

🎯 Objectives:

🗂️ Data Management: Used MySQL to organize and manage the large dataset, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of information.

📊 Sales Distribution by Platform: Analyzed how sales are distributed across different gaming platforms through complex SQL queries.

📈 Yearly Global Sales Trend: Identified trends in global video game sales over the years using MySQL's aggregation functions.

🏆 Top Publishers and Games: Determined the top 5 publishers by global sales and identified the games with the highest sales, utilizing JOINs and GROUP BY clauses.

🌍 Region-Wise Sales Analysis: Segmented sales data by region using SELECT and WHERE clauses, offering insights into regional preferences and trends.

🎮 Sales by Genre: Explored how different genres performed in terms of sales, providing a deeper understanding of market dynamics.

🚀 Outcome: The analysis provided valuable insights into the video game industry's sales patterns, helping to identify key trends, successful genres, and leading platforms. MySQL's robust querying capabilities allowed for in-depth data analysis and effective decision-making.
